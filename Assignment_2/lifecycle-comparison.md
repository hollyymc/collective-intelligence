### How does adding sexual reproduction and death, to imitate a biological lifecycle, affect population dynamics compared to the baseline model?

#### H<sub>0</sub>: Lifecycle model does not significantly change population dynamics from the baseline model.
#### H<sub>1</sub>: Lifecycle model significantly changes dynamics (mean survival duration, extinction probability)
